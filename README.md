# Whos-There-Discord

One thing I wanted discord to tell me was when people join 
a voice channel in my private discord by notifying me on 
my phone. This way, I know when my friends are online and
ready to play or chat. Unfortunately, this was not possible
so I had to implement this through a Discord Bot. This is my
2nd ever Discord bot and I implemented using OOP and more than one file
compared to my first ever bot. 

If it is in your discord server, you will have to DM him the 
command "subscribe" and do what you are told to then subscribe
for notifications on a server. When subscribed, you will receive
message in your discords DM every time someone joins or leave
a voice channel in that discord server. This message will make a 
notification on your phone. So even if you are not on your PC, you
know if someone is online to play. One of the added benefits is knowing
how late does your night owl friends stays up by knowing at what time he
leaves the voice chat.
Here is an example of messages the bot sends.
